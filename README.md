# Data-Analytics-Project
This contains my final project for my Data Analytics with Project Management Bootcamp. 

As part of my project, I used a financial dataset consisting of a number of credit card customers, including their demographics. A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving the credit card services. My role was to conduct analysis and predict who is going to get churned. For my analysis, I used Microsoft Excel, SQL, Python and Power BI for my visualisation. I then presented my findings, insights and recommendations to others on the bootcamp.
